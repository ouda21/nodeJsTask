## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

IMPORTANT DATA
************************************************************
`run npm install`.
`create a .env file`.
    In the .env file, Include the following:
    `API_PORT = port_number`.
    `DB_USERNAME = "database_username"`.
    `DB_PASSWORD = "your password"`.
    `DB_NAME = "database name"`.
*************************************************************


After the connection the database is successful,
Run:

**** `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` ---- This will create your tables in the database
**** `npx sequlize-cli db:seed` ----- Ths will fill your table with dummy data based on faker data


End Points 
***************************************************************
`localhost:port/api/vi/add-student ********* {post}`
`localhost:port/api/vi/all-students ******** {get}`
`localhost:port/api/vi/get-single-student/id ******* {get}`
`localhost:port/api/vi/update-student/id ********** {put}`
`localhost:port/api/vi/delete-student/id ************ {delete}`

***************************************************************
```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
